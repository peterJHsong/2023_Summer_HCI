It is a code that measures the soil moisture of plants, moisture in the surrounding atmosphere, and temperature and stores them in Firebase Realtime DB.
Locate the most recently stored number in the RTDB, and save the +1 value from that number as ESP32's own number.
This number is the code that stores temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in subcategories.
The developer must set up a Pin number for the WIFI SSID, PW, and his ESP32.
In this experiment, we used the wemos D1 mini ESP32 board.
